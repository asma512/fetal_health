## Problem 
Fetal mortality is a major, but often overlooked, public health (MacDorman et al, 2009). The U.S. fetal mortality rate in 2019 was 5.70 fetal deaths at 20 or more weeks of gestation per 1,000 live births and fetal deaths (Gregory et al., 2021). With fetal mortality comes a higher chance of adverse maternal health outcomes, as well as a higher risk of maternal mortality. The U.S maternal mortality rate for 2019 was 20.1 deaths per 100,000 live births (Hoyert, 2019). Child mortality reduction is an important indication of human progress and is reflected in several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (Ayres De Campos et al, 2020). By 2030, the United Nations expects countries to have eliminated preventable deaths of newborns and children under the age of five, with all countries aiming to reduce under-five mortality to at least 25 per 1,000 live births (Ayres De Campos et al, 2020).

## Dataset
I used a Cardiotocography exam dataset found on Kaggle from The Journal of Maternal-Fetal Medicine. The dataset contains 2,126 rows of 22 features extracted from Cardiotocography exams which were classified by three expert obstetricians to three fetal health states which are normal, suspect, pathological. These are the target values the models will be predicting. All the other features are numerical and have their respective units.
